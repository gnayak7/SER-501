Magna Carta John, by the grace of God, king of England, lord of Ireland, duke of
Normandy and Aquitaine, and count of Anjou, to the archbishops, bishops, abbots,
earls, barons, justiciars, foresters, sheriffs, stewards, servants, and to all
his bailiffs and faithful subjects, greeting. Know that we, out of reverence
for God and for the salvation of our soul and those of all our ancestors and
heirs, for the honour of God and the exaltation of holy church, and for the
reform of our realm, on the advice of our venerable fathers, Stephen, archbishop
of Canterbury, primate of all England and cardinal of the holy Roman church,
Henry archbishop of Dublin, William of London, Peter of Winchester, Jocelyn of
Bath and Glastonbury, Hugh of Lincoln, Walter of Worcester, William of Coventry
and Benedict of Rochester, bishops, of master Pandulf, subdeacon and member
of the household of the lord pope, of brother Aymeric, master of the order
of Knights Templar in England, and of the noble men William Marshal earl of
Pembroke, William earl of Salisbury, William earl of Warenne, William earl of
Arundel, Alan of Galloway constable of Scotland, Warin fitz Gerold, Peter fitz
Herbert, Hubert de Burgh seneschal of Poitou, Hugh de Neville, Matthew fitz
Herbert, Thomas Basset, Alan Basset, Philip de Aubeney, Robert of Ropsley, John
Marshal, John fitz Hugh, and others, our faithful subjects: [1] In the first
place have granted to God, and by this our present charter confirmed for us
and our heirs for ever that the English church shall be free, and shall have
its rights undiminished and its liberties unimpaired; and it is our will that
it be thus observed; which is evident from the fact that, before the quarrel
between us and our barons began, we willingly and spontaneously granted and by
our charter confirmed the freedom of elections which is reckoned most important
and very essential to the English church, and obtained confirmation of it from
the lord pope Innocent III; the which we will observe and we wish our heirs
to observe it in good faith for ever. We have also granted to all free men of
our kingdom, for ourselves and our heirs for ever, all the liberties written
below, to be had and held by them and their heirs of us and our heirs. [2] If
any of our earls or barons or others holding of us in chief by knight service
dies, and at his death his heir be of full age and owe relief he shall have his
inheritance on payment of the old relief, namely the heir or heirs of an earl
œ100 for a whole earl's barony, the heir of heirs of a baron œ100 for a whole
barony, the heir or heirs of a knight 100s, at most, for a whole knight's fee;
and he who owes less shall give less according to the ancient usage of fiefs.
[3] If, however, the heir of any such be under age and a ward, he shall have his
inheritance when he comes of age without paying relief and without making fine.
[4] The guardian of the land of such an heir who is under age shall take from
the land of the heir no more than reasonable revenues, reasonable customary dues
and reasonable services and that without destruction and waste of men or goods;
and if we commit the wardship of the land of any such to a sheriff, or to any
other who is answerable to us for its revenues, and he destroys or wastes what
he has wardship of, we will take compensation from him and the land shall be
committed to two lawful and discreet men of that fief, who shall be answerable
for the revenues to us or to him to whom we have assigned them; and if we give
or sell to anyone the wardship of any such land and he causes destruction or
waste therein, he shall lose that wardship, and it shall be transferred to two
lawful and discreet men of that fief, who shall similarly be answerable to us
as is aforesaid. [5] Moreover, so long as he has the wardship of the land, the
guardian shall keep in repair the houses, parks, preserves, ponds, mills and
other things pertaining to the land out of the revenues from it; and he shall
restore to the heir when he comes of age his land fully stocked with ploughs and
the means of husbandry according to what the season of husbandry requires and
the revenues of the land can reasonably bear. [6] Heirs shall be married without
disparagement, yet so that before the marriage is contracted those nearest in
blood to the heir shall have notice. [7] A widow shall have her marriage portion
and inheritance forthwith and without difficulty after the death of her husband;
nor shall she pay anything to have her dower or her marriage portion or the
inheritance which she and her husband held on the day of her husband's death;
and she may remain in her husband's house for forty days after his death, within
which time her dower shall be assigned to her. [8] No widow shall be forced to
marry so long as she wishes to live without a husband, provided that she gives
security not to marry without our consent if she holds of us, or without the
consent of her lord of whom she holds, if she holds of another. [9] Neither
we nor our bailiffs will seize for any debt any land or rent, so long as the
chattles of the debtor are sufficient to repay the debt; nor will those who
have gone surety for the debtor be distrained so long as the principal debtor
is himself able to pay the debt; and if the principal debtor fails to pay the
debt, having nothing wherewith to pay it, then shall the sureties answer for
the debt; and they shall, if they wish, have the lands and rents of the debtor
until they are reimbursed for the debt which they have paid for him, unless the
principal debtor can show that he has discharged his obligation in the matter to
the said sureties. [10] If anyone who has borrowed from the Jews any sum, great
or small, dies before it is repaid, the debt shall not bear interest as long as
the heir is under age, of whomsoever he holds; and if the debt falls into our
hands, we will not take anything except the principal mentioned in the bond.
[11] And if anyone dies indebted to the Jews, his wife shall have her dower and
pay nothing of that debt; and if the dead man leaves children who are under age,
they shall be provided whith necessaries befitting the holding of the deceased;
and the debt shall be paid out of the residue, reserving, however, service due
to lords of the land; debts owing to others than Jews shall be dealt with in
like manner. [12] No scutage or aid shall be imposed in our kingdom unless by
common counsel of our kingdom, except for ransoming our person, for making our
eldest son a knight, and for once marrying our eldest daughter; and for these
only a reasonable aid shall be levied. Be it done in like manner oncerning aids
from the city of London. [13] And the city of London shall have all its ancient
liberties and free customs as well by land as by water. Furthermore, we will and
grant that all other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports shall have all their
liberties and free customs. [14] And to obtain the common counsel of the kingdom
about the assessing of an aid (except in the three cases aforesaid) or of a
scutage, we will cause to be summoned the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls
and greater barons, individually by our letters-and, in additon, we will cause
to be summoned generally through our sheriffs and bailiffs all those holding of
us in chief-for a fixed date, namely, after the expiry of at least forty day,
and to a fixed place; and in all letters of such summons we will specify the
reason for the summons. And when the summons has thus been made, the business
shall proceed on the day appointed, according to the counsel of those present,
though not all have come who were summoned. [15] We will not in future grant
any one the right to take an aid from his free men, except for ransoming his
person, for making his eldest son a knight and for once marrying his eldest
daughter, and for these only a resonable aid shall be levied. [16] No one shall
be compelled to do greater service for a kngiht's fee or for any other free
holding than is due form it. [17] Common pleas shall not follow our court, but
shall be held in some fixed place. [18] Recognitions of novel disseisin, of
mort d'ancester, and of darrein presentment, shall not be held elsewhere than
in the counties to which they relate, and in this manner-we, or, if we should
be out of the realm, our chief justiciar, will send two justices through each
county four times a year, who, with four knights of each county chosen by the
county, shall hold the said assizes in the county and on the day and in the
place of meeting of the county court. [19] And if the said assizes cannot all
be held on the day of the county court, there shall stay behind as many of the
kngihts and freeholders who were present at the county court on that day as are
necessary for the sufficient making of judgments, according to the amount of
business to be done. [20] A free man shall not be amerced for a trivial offence
except in accordance with the degree of the offence, and for a grave offence he
shall be amerced in accordance with its gravity, yet saving his way of living;
and a merchant in the same way, saving his stock-in-trade; and a villein shall
be amerced in the same way, saving his means of livelihood-if they have fallen
into our mercy: and none of the aforesaid amercements shall be imposed except
by the oath of good men of the neighbourhood. [21] Earls and barons shall not
be amerced except by their peers, and only in accordance with the degree of the
offence. [22] No clerk shall be amerced in respect of his lay holding except
after the manner of the others aforesaid and not according to the amount of his
ecclesiastical benefice. [23] No vill or individual shall be compelled to make
bridges at river banks, except those who from of old are legally bound to do
so. [24] No sheriff, constable, coroners, or others of our bailiffs, shall hold
pleas of our crown. [25] All counties, hundreds, wapentakes and trithings shall
be at the old rents without any additional payment, except our demesne manors.
[26] If anyone holding a lay fief of us dies and our sheriff or bailiff shows
our letters patent of summons for a debt that the deceased owed us, it shall be
lawful for our sheriff or bailiff to attach and make a list of chattels of the
deceased found upon the lay fief to the value of that debt under the supervision
of law-worthy men, provided that none of the chattels shall be removed until
the debt which is manifest has been paid to us in full; and the residue shall
be left to the executors for carrying out the will of the deceased. And if
nothing is owing to us from him, all the chattels shall accrue to the deceased,
saving to his wife and children their reasonable shares. [27] If any free man
dies without leaving a will, his chattels shall be distributed by his nearest
kinsfolk and friends under the supervison of the church, saving to every one
the debts which the deceased owed him. [28] No constable or other bailiff of
ours shall take anyone's corn or other chattels unless he pays on the spot
in cash for them or can delay payment by arrangment with the seller. [29] No
constable shall compel any knight to give money instead of castle-guard if he
is willing to do the guard himself or through another good man, if for some
good reason he cannot do it himself; and if we lead or send him on military
service, he shall be excused guard in proportion to the time that because of
us he has been on service. [30] No sheriff, or bailiff of ours, or anyone else
shall take the horses or carts of any free man for transport work save with
the agreement of that freeman. [31] Neither we nor our bailiffs will take,
for castles or other works of ours, timber which is not ours, except with the
agreement of him whose timber it is. [32] We will not hold for more than a year
and a day the lands of those convicted of felony, and then the lands shall be
handed over to the lords of the fiefs. [33] Henceforth all fish-weirs shall be
cleared completely from the Thames and the Medway and throughout all England,
except along the sea coast. [34] The writ called Praecipe shall not in future
be issued to anyone in respect of any holding whereby a free man may lose his
court. [35] Let there be one measure for wine throughout our kingdom, and one
measure for ale, and one measure for corn, namely "the London quarter"; and
one width for cloths whether dyed, russet or halberget, namely two ells within
the selvedges. Let it be the same with weights as with measures. [36] Nothing
shall be given or taken in future for the writ of inquisition of life or limbs:
instead it shall be granted free of charge and not refused. [37] If anyone
holds of us by fee-farm, by socage, or by burgage, and holds land of another by
knight service, we will not, by reason of that fee-farm, socage, or burgage,
have the wardship of his heir or of land of land of his that is of the fief
of the other; nor will we have custody of the fee-farm, socage, or burgage,
unless such fee-farm owes kngiht service. We will not have custody of anyone's
heir or land which he holds of another by knight service by reason of any petty
serjeanty which he holds of us by the service of rendering to us knives or
arrows or the like. [38] No bailiff shall in future put anyone to trial upon
his own bare word, without reliable witnesses produced for this purpose. [39]
No free man shall be arrested or imprisoned or disseised or outlawed or exiled
or in any way victimised, neither will we attack him or send anyone to attack
him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land. [40]
To no one will we sell, to no one will we refuse or delay right or justice.
[41] All merchants shall be able to go out of and come into England safely and
securely and stay and travel throughout England, as well by land as by water,
for buying and selling by the ancient and right customs free from all evil
tolls, except in time of war and if they are of the land that is at war with
us. And if such are found in our land at the beginning of a war, they shall
be attached, without injury to their persons or goods, until we, or our chief
justiciar, know how merchants of our land are treated who were found in the
land at war with us when war broke out, and if ours are safe there, the others
shall be safe in our land. [42] It shall be lawful in future for anyone, without
prejudicing the allegiance due to us, to leave our kingdom and return safely and
securely by land and water, save, in the public interest, for a short period
in time of war-except for those imprisoned or outlawed in accordance with the
law of the kingdom and natives of a land that is at war with us and merchants
(who shall be treated as aforesaid). [43] If anyone who holds of some escheat
such as the honour of Wallingford, Nottingham, Boulogne, Lancaster, or of other
escheats which are in our hands and are baronies dies, his heir shall give no
other relief and do no other service to us than he would have done to the baron
if that barony had been in the baron's hands; and we will hold it in the same
manner in which the baron held it. [44] Men who live outside the forest need not
henceforth come before our justices of the forest upon a general summons, unless
they are impleaded or are sureties for any person or persons who are attached
for forest offences. [45] We will not make justices, constables, sheriffs or
bailiffs save of such as know the law of the kingdom and mean to observe it
well. [46] All barons who have founded abbeys for which they have charters of
the kings of England or ancient tenure shall have the custody of them during
vacancies, as they ought to have. [47] All forests that have been make forest
in our time shall be immediately disafforested; and so be it done with river
banks that have been made preserves by us in our time. [48] All evil customs
connected with forests and warrens, foresters and warreners, sheriffs and their
officials, riverbanks and their wardens shall immediately be inquired into in
each county by twelve sworn kngihts of the same county, and within forty days
of the completion of the inquiry shall be utterly abolished by them so as never
to be restored, provided that we, or our justiciar if we are not in England,
know of it first. [49] We will immediately return all hostages and charters
given to us by Englishmen, as security for peace or faithful service. [50] We
will remove completely from office the relations of Gerard de Athee so that in
future they shall have no office in England, namely Engelard de Cigogne, Peter
and Guy and Andrew de Chanceaux, Guy de cigogne, Geoffrey de Maartigny and his
brothers, Philip Marc and his brothers and his nephew Geoffrey, and all their
following. [51] As soon as peace is restored, we will remove from the kingdom
all foreign knights, cross-bowmen, serjeants, and mercenaries, who have come
with horses and arms to the detriment of the kingdom. [52] If anyone has been
disseised of or kept out of his lands, castles, franchises or his right by us
without the legal judgment of his peers, we will immediately restore them to
him: and if a dispute arises over this, then let it be decided by the judgment
of the twenty-five barons who are mentioned below in the clause for securing the
peace: for all the things, however, which anyone has been disseised or kept out
of without the lawful judgment of his peers by king Henry, our father, or by
king Richard, our brother, which we have in our hand or are held by others, to
whom we are bound to warrant them, we will have the usual period of respite of
crusaders, excepting those things about which a plea was started or an inquest
made by our command before we took the cross; when however we return from our
pilgrimage, or if by any chance we do not go on it, we will at once do full
justice therein. [53] We will have the same respite, and in the same manner, in
the doing of justice in the matter of the disafforesting or retaining of the
forests which Henry our father or Richard our brother afforested, and in the
matter of the wardship of lands which are of the fief of another, wardships of
which sort we have hitherto had by reason of a fief which anyone held of us by
knight service, and in the matter of abbeys founded on the fief of another, not
on a fief of our own, in which the lord of the fief claims he has a right; and
when we have returned, or if we do not set out on our pilgrimage, we will at
once do full justice to those who complain of these things. [54] No one shall
be arrested or imprisoned upon the appeal of a woman for the death of anyone
except her husband. [55] All fines made with us unjustly and against the law
of the land, and all amercements imposed unjustly and against the law of the
land, shall be entirely remitted, or else let them be settled by the judgment of
the twenty- five barons who are mentioned below in the clause for securing the
peace, or by the judgment of the majority of the same, along with the aforesaid
Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, if he can be present, and such others as he
may wish to associate with himself for this purpose, and if he cannot be present
the business shall nevertheless proceed without him, provided that if any one
or more of of the aforesaid twenty-five barons are in a like suit, they shall
be removed from the judgment of the case in question, and others chosen, sworn
and put in their place by the rest of the same twenty-five for this case only.
[56] If we have disseised or kept out Welshmen from lands or liberties or other
things without the legal judgment of their peers in England or in Wales, they
shall be immediately restored to them; and if a dispute arises over this, then
let it be decided in the March by the judgment of their peers-for holdings in
England according to the law of England, for holdings in Wales according to the
law of Wales, and for holdings in the March according to the law of the March.
Welshmen shall do the same to us and ours. [57] For all the things, however,
which any Welshman was disseised of or kept out of without the lawful judgment
of his peers by king Henry, our father, or king Richard, our brother, which we
have in our hand or which are held by others, to whom we are bound to warrent
them, we will have the usual period of respite of crusaders, excepting those
things about which a plea was started or an inquest made by our command before
we took the cross; when however we return, or if by any chance we do not set
out on our pilgrimage, we will at once do full justice to them in accordance
with the laws of the Welsh and the foresaid regions. [58] We will give back
at once the son of Llywelyn and all the hostages from Wales and the charters
that were handed over to us as security for peace. [59] We will act toward
Alexander, king of the Scots, concerning the return of his sisters and hostages
and concerning his franchises and his right in the same manner in which we act
towards our other barons of England, unless it ought to be otherwise by the
charters which we have from William his father, formerly king of the Scots, and
this shall be determined by the judgment of his peers in our court. [60] All
these aforesaid customs and liberties which we have granted to be observed in
our kingdom as far as it pertains to us towards our men, all of our kingdom,
clerks as well as laymen, shall observe as far as it pertains to them towards
their men. [61] Since, moreover, for God and the betterment of our kingdom and
for the better allaying of the discord that has arisen between us and our barons
we have granted all these things aforesaid, wishing them to enjoy the use of
them unimpaired and unshaken for ever, we give and grant them the under-written
security, namely, that the barons shall choose any twenty-five barons of the
kingdom they wish, who must with all their might observe, hold and cause to
be observed, the peace and liberties which we have granted and confirmed to
them by this present charter of ours, so that if we, or our justiciar, or
our bailiffs or any one of our servants offend in any way against anyone or
transgress any of the articles of the peace or the security and the offence be
notified to four of the aforesaid twenty-five barons, those four barons shall
come to us, or to our justiciar if we are out of the kingdom, and, laying
the transgression before us, shall petition us to have that transgression
corrected without delay. And if we do not correct the transgression, or if we
are out of the kingdom, if our justiciar does not correct it, within forty
days, reckoning from the time it was brought to our notice or to that of our
justiciar if we were out of the kingdom, the aforesaid four barons shall refer
that case to the rest of the twenty-five barons and those twenty-five barons
together with the community of the whole land shall distrain and distress us
in every way they can, namely, by seizing castles, lands, possessions, and in
such other ways as they can, saving our person and the persons of our queen and
our children, until, in their opinion, amends have been made; and when amends
have been made, they shall obey us as they did before. And let anyone in the
land who wishes take an oath to obey the orders of the said twenty-five barons
for the execution of all the aforesaid matters, and with them to distress us
as much as he can, and we publicly and freely give anyone leave to take the
oath who wishes to take it and we will never prohibit anyone from taking it.
Indeed, all those in the land who are unwilling of themselves and of their
own accord to take an oath to the twenty-five barons to help them to distrain
and distress us, we will make them take the oath as aforesaid at our command.
And if any of the twenty-five barons dies or leaves the country or is in any
other way prevented from carrying out the things aforesaid, the rest of the
aforesaid twenty-five barons shall choose as they think fit another one in his
place, and he shall take the oath like the rest. In all matters the execution
of which is committed to these twenty-five barons, if it should happen that
these twenty-five are present yet disagree among themselves about anything,
or if some of those summoned will not or cannot be present, that shall be
held as fixed and established which the majority of those present ordained
or commanded, exactly as if all the twenty-five had consented to it; and the
said twenty-five shall swear that they will faithfully observe all the things
aforesaid and will do all they can to get them observed. And we will procure
nothing from anyone, either personally or through anyone else, whereby any of
these concessions and liberties might be revoked or diminished; and if any such
thing is procured, let it be void and null, and we will never use it either
personally or through another. [62] And we have fully remitted and pardoned to
everyone all the ill-will, indignation and rancour that have arisen between
us and our men, clergy and laity, from the time of the quarrel. Furthermore,
we have fully remitted to all, clergy and laity, and as far as pertains to us
have completely forgiven, all trespasses occasioned by the same quarrel between
Easter in the sixteenth year of our reign and the restoration of peace. And,
besides, we have caused to be made for them letters testimonial patent of the
lord Stephen archbishop of Canterbury, of the lord Henry archbishop of Dublin
and of the aforementioned bishops and of master Pandulf about this security
and the aforementioned concessions. [63] Wherefore we wish and firmly enjoin
that the English church shall be free, and that the men in our kingdom shall
have and hold all the aforesaid liberties, rights and concessions well and
peacefully, freely and quietly, fully and completely, for themselves and their
heirs from us and our heirs, in all matters and in all places for ever, as is
aforesaid. An oath, moreover, has been taken, as well on our part as on the
part of the barons, that all these things aforesaid shall be observed in good
faith and without evil disposition. Witness the above-mentioned and many others.
Given by our hand in the meadow which is called Runnymede between Windsor and
Staines on the fifteenth day of June, in the seventeenth year of our reign. 

In Xanadu did KubIa Khan A stately pleasure dome decree: Where Alph, the
sacred river, ran Through caverns measureless to man Down to a sunless sea. So
twice five miles of fertile ground With walls and towers were girdled round:
And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills, Where blossomed many an
incense-bearing tree; And here were forests ancient as the hills, Enfolding
sunny spots of greenery. But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted Down
the green hill athwart a cedarn cover! A savage place! as holy and enchanted As
e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon lover!
And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething, As if this earth in fast
thick pants were breathing, A mighty fountain momently was forced: Amid whose
swift half-intermitted burst Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail, Or
chafly grain beneath the thresher's flail: And `mid these dancing rocks at
once and ever It flung up momently the sacred river. Five miles meandering
with a mazy motion Through wood and dale the sacred river ran, Then reached
the caverns measureless to man, And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean: And
`mid this tumult KubIa heard from far Ancestral voices prophesying war! The
shadow of the dome of pleasure Floated midway on the waves; Where was heard
the mingled measure From the fountain and the caves. It was a miracle of rare
device, A sunny pleasure dome with caves of ice! A damsel with a dulcimer
In a vision once I saw: It was an Abyssinian maid, And on her dulcimer she
played, Singing of Mount Abora. Could I revive within me Her symphony and
song, To such a deep delight `twould win me, That with music loud and long, I
would build that dome in air, That sunny dome! those caves of ice! And all who
heard should see them there, And all should cry, Beware! Beware! His flashing
eyes, his floating hair! Weave a circle round him thrice, And close your eyes
with holy dread, For he on honeydew hath fed, And drunk the milk of Paradise.
